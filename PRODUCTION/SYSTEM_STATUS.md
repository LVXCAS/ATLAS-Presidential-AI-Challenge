## Performance Comparison

### Current System (Tier 1 Only)
- Backtest 1 strategy: ~30 seconds
- Research cycle: ~10 minutes
- Strategies tested: 5-10 per cycle
- Learning: Manual adjustments

### With ML (Tier 1 + 2)
- Auto-discovers novel patterns
- Strategy generation: automatic
- Continuous learning: self-improving
- Strategies tested: 20-50 per cycle

### With GPU (All 3 Tiers)
- Backtest 1 strategy: ~0.3 seconds (100x faster)
- Research cycle: ~1 minute (10x faster)
- Strategies tested: 1000+ per cycle (100x more)
- Learning: Neural network optimization

**Example:**
- Test 1000 strategies on 6 months data
  - CPU: ~8 hours
  - GPU: ~5 minutes
