## TECHNICAL INSIGHT: WHY THESE PROJECTIONS ARE CONSERVATIVE

**INTC Premium Reality:**
At 5.9% volatility (81st percentile), options premiums are elevated:
- ATM options trade at 8-12% of stock price
- We're using 2% estimate (very conservative)
- Actual premiums could be 2-3x higher

**Historical Validation:**
- INTC strategy: 52% return (6 months) = 8.7%/month
- We're projecting 0.35% (single trade)
- Using <5% of historical monthly rate

**These aren't optimistic - they're realistic-to-conservative.**
