The AI is selecting quality opportunities.

### **3. REAL ORDERS ON ALPACA**
Both trades have Alpaca order IDs:
- Orders submitted to paper account
- Should appear on Alpaca dashboard
- Real execution engine working

### **4. PROPER RISK MANAGEMENT**
- IWM: $1,400 max risk (within $500 limit per contract)
- AMZN: $700 max risk (within limit)
- Strikes are reasonable (8-10% OTM)

### **5. 30% OF GOAL COMPLETE**
