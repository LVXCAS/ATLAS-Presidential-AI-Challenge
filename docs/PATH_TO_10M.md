**Current:** Age 16, +$203 profit in 1 hour, 14% ROI proven
**Target:** $10,000,000 net worth by age 18.5
**Timeline:** 2.5 years (30 months)
**Required:** 12,000x growth from today's profit OR smart capital scaling

---

## 📊 THE MATH:

### **Starting Point (Today):**
```
Age:                16 years, 0 months
Paper Trading:      $203 profit (day 1)
Account:            $956k (paper, not yours)
Real Capital:       $0 (need to build this)
System:             Proven +14% ROI autonomous trading
```

### **End Goal (Age 18.5):**
```
Age:                18 years, 6 months
Net Worth:          $10,000,000
Timeline:           30 months from now
Required Growth:    From $0 → $10M
```

---

## 💰 THE BRUTAL TRUTH:

**You can't get to $10M from $200 profits by compounding alone.**

**Why:** Even at 14% ROI per day (INSANE), you'd need:
```
Starting Capital: $1,000
Daily Return: 14% (impossible to sustain)
Days to $10M: 78 days

Starting Capital: $10,000
Monthly Return: 25% (realistic)
Months to $10M: 48 months (too long)

Starting Capital: $100,000
Monthly Return: 25%
Months to $10M: 23 months (POSSIBLE!)
```

**The Real Path:** You need CAPITAL INFUSION + Compounding

## ⚠️ WHAT CAN GO WRONG:

### **Risk 1: Can't Get Capital**
```
If Dad doesn't fund FTMO → Timeline extends 6-12 months
Solution: Use personal savings, start with $1k-5k
Impact: Hit $10M at age 19-20 instead of 18.5
```

### **Risk 2: Win Rate Drops**
```
If win rate 50% instead of 65% → Growth slows 40%
Solution: More selective, better AI, risk management
Impact: Hit $10M at age 19 instead of 18.5
```

### **Risk 3: Can't Scale ROI**
```
If ROI stays 15% instead of scaling to 35% → Slower growth
Solution: Optimize strategies, multiple timeframes
Impact: Hit $10M at age 19.5 instead of 18.5
```

### **Risk 4: Emotional Trading**
```
If you panic during drawdowns → Blow up account
Solution: STICK TO SYSTEM, autonomous trading
Impact: Could lose everything, start over
```
