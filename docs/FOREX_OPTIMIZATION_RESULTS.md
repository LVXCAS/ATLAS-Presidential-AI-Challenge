## KEY FINDINGS

1. **Daily Timeframe:** Switched from 1-hour to daily candles
   - Reduced noise and false signals
   - Better trend identification
   - More reliable EMA crossovers

2. **Fixed USD/JPY Pip Calculation:**
   - JPY pairs quote to 2 decimals (147.55) → 1 pip = 0.01
   - Other pairs quote to 5 decimals (1.15740) → 1 pip = 0.0001
   - Previous calculation was showing -20,015 pip errors

3. **Parameter Optimization:**
   - Tested 8 different EMA combinations
   - Validated across 3 major forex pairs
   - Found optimal balance between signal frequency and accuracy

### Recommendations:

1. **Use the recommended parameters above** for live trading
2. **Continue testing** on daily timeframe for 30 more days before going live
3. **Monitor performance** - recalibrate if win rate drops below 60%
4. **Risk management** - Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
5. **Start small** - Begin with minimum position sizes

### Next Steps:

- [ ] Update strategy files with optimized parameters
- [ ] Run forward test for 30 days
- [ ] Implement in paper trading account
