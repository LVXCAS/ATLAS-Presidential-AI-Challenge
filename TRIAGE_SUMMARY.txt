================================================================================
                    ROOT CAUSE & FIX
================================================================================

ROOT CAUSE:
  System configuration allows too much stock trading
  - Should be OPTIONS-first strategy
  - Currently trading 2.9x more stocks than options
  - No position limits or stop losses enforced

THE FIX:
  1. Disable stock fallback in strategy configs
  2. Add position size limits (5% max)
  3. Enable automatic stop losses (-10% stocks, -50% options)
  4. Focus on options spreads (iron condors, bull puts)
  5. Daily monitoring (not weekly)

FILES TO CHECK:
  - week3_production_scanner.py
  - auto_options_scanner.py
  - Execution engines in PRODUCTION/
  - Risk management configs

                    FINAL NOTE
================================================================================

The massive AMD/ORCL positions from the original alert DO NOT EXIST.
The real problem is: system trading stocks instead of options.

Tomorrow morning's cleanup will finish the job.
Then we fix the configs to prevent this from happening again.

You've got this. 💪
