# ATLAS Safety & Ethics Statement

ATLAS is an education-first, simulation-only AI risk literacy system for K-12 Track II.
It is designed to teach caution and explainability, not to encourage trading or
predict outcomes.

## Safety constraints (non-negotiable)
- No live data feeds
- No brokerage integrations or order execution
- No real money or accounts
- No financial advice or guarantees
- Offline, deterministic demos only

## Educational intent
- Focuses on risk, uncertainty, and decision discipline
- Explains *why* conditions are risky instead of recommending actions
- Returns NEUTRAL when data is insufficient

## Age-appropriate design
- Clear disclaimers on every demo output
- Plain-language explanations and short reasoning strings
- Avoids complex financial jargon or profit promises

## Data handling and privacy
- Uses cached historical CSVs or synthetic data only
- No personal data is collected or processed
- No API keys are required to run the Track II demo

## Transparency and limitations
- All agent signals are interpretable and documented
- Outputs are meant for learning, not decision-making
- The system intentionally avoids prediction claims

## Responsible use
ATLAS should be used as a classroom-style learning tool to discuss
uncertainty, risk flags, and when not to act. It should not be used for
real-world trading decisions.
