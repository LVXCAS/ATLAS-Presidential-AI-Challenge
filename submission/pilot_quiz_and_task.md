# Micro Pilot Materials (Track II)

Purpose: generate real, small-sample evidence that the tool improves risk understanding and decision discipline.

## Participants
- Target: 5–10 students from an investment club or finance class.
- Time required: 15–25 minutes total.

## Pre/Post Scenario Quiz (10 items)

Instructions to students:
“For each scenario, choose the best desk stance label: GREENLIGHT / WATCH / STAND_DOWN. Then write 1 sentence explaining why.”

Scoring rubric:
- 1 point for correct label
- +1 point if explanation mentions uncertainty, volatility, regime change, correlation/exposure, or constraints

### Scenarios (edit to match your stress windows)
1) Low volatility range; indicators mixed; no clear trend.  
2) Sudden volatility spike; large candles; whipsaw.  
3) Strong trend with moderate volatility; trend strength high.  
4) Trend weakening + volatility rising (possible regime shift).  
5) Two assets move together; adding exposure increases correlation risk.  
6) Conflicting signals: momentum says up, regime says choppy.  
7) News/event risk approaching (macro uncertainty).  
8) Thin data / missing context (uncertainty high).  
9) Stable conditions but sentiment headlines extremely negative.  
10) High volatility + repeated reversals (false breakouts).

Answer key template (fill in and keep consistent):
- 1) GREENLIGHT
- 2) STAND_DOWN
- 3) WATCH (or GREENLIGHT, depending on your teaching goals)
- 4) STAND_DOWN

## Decision Task (5 minutes)

Give students one “stress window” printout or screenshot and ask:
1) Would you take risk in this moment? (yes/no)  
2) If yes, what constraint would you add? (size down, wait for confirmation, etc.)  
3) If no, what would you wait for to re-enter “GREENLIGHT” conditions?

## Feedback (qualitative)
Ask 3 questions:
1) “What output helped you the most?”  
2) “What output confused you?”  
3) “What would make this safer or clearer?”

## Iteration log (required for credibility)
Document at least one change you made after the pilot:
- Example: renamed “confidence” to “uncertainty,” added a bold STAND_DOWN banner, added a ‘not advice’ reminder on every screen.
