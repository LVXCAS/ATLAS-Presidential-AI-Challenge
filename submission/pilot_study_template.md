---

### 3.2 Demo Walkthrough Outline

**Script followed (or customize below):**

#### 0:00–0:20 — Hook (Problem)
"Student investment clubs rarely have access to institutional-style quantitative research. We built an AI 'quant desk' made of specialist agents that explains market regime and uncertainty so you can practice better decision discipline."

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 0:20–0:40 — What This Is / Is Not
"This is **not** financial advice and it does not place trades. It outputs a simple desk stance—**GREENLIGHT**, **WATCH**, or **STAND_DOWN**—plus an explanation and constraints like 'volatility spike' or 'regime shift.'"

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 0:40–1:20 — Baseline (Static Rules Can Fail)
**Baseline description:** "The baseline uses simple RSI and ATR rules."

**Command(s) demonstrated:**
```bash
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_eval.py --data-source synthetic
```

**Output shown:**
[PASTE KEY METRICS OR SCREENSHOT]

**Commentary given:** "The baseline can look confident even during stress windows—exactly when beginners make catastrophic mistakes."

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 1:20–2:40 — Quant Desk Walkthrough (2 Stress Windows)
**Stress windows demonstrated:**
- [ ] Volatility spike
- [ ] Regime shift
- [ ] Other: [SPECIFY]

**Command(s) run:**
```bash
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_demo.py --data-source synthetic --window [WINDOW]
```

**Output shown (Participant 1):**
[PASTE DEMO OUTPUT OR KEY LINES]

**Key outputs highlighted to participant:**
- [ ] Summary lines (desk stance + explanation)
- [ ] Constraint flags (e.g., "elevated uncertainty")
- [ ] Agent perspectives
- [ ] Other: [SPECIFY]

**Concrete constraints/flags mentioned:**
1. [CONSTRAINT 1]
2. [CONSTRAINT 2]

**Commentary given:** "Instead of a buy/sell signal, the AI desk summarizes multiple specialist views into a single stance and explains why. The goal is teaching decision discipline: wait, reduce exposure, or stand down when conditions are unstable."

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

**Command(s) run:**
```bash
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_demo.py --data-source synthetic --window [WINDOW]
```

**Output shown (Participant 2):**
[PASTE DEMO OUTPUT OR KEY LINES]

**Key outputs highlighted:**
- [ ] Summary lines
- [ ] Constraint flags
- [ ] Agent perspectives

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 2:40–3:20 — Evidence (Headline Metric)
**File opened:** `submission/evaluation_results.json`

**Key metric shown:** GREENLIGHT-in-stress rate

**Interpretation given:** "Lower is better because saying 'GREENLIGHT' during stress is false confidence. In our run, the AI quant team reduces GREENLIGHT-in-stress compared to the baseline."

**Specific numbers shown:**
- Baseline GREENLIGHT-in-stress: [ ]%
- AI team GREENLIGHT-in-stress: [ ]%
- Improvement: [ ] percentage points

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 3:20–3:50 — Pilot Plan / Learning Outcome
**Commentary given:** "Our primary outcome is learning and behavior. We measure improvement in a scenario-based risk decision quiz before and after using the tool. We also capture feedback and iterate based on what you misunderstand."

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

#### 3:50–4:00 — Responsibility
**Commentary given:** "We designed this responsibly: no personal data, no automated execution, and clear warnings on every screen. The goal is safer participation and better risk literacy."

**Participant reaction/questions:** [DESCRIBE]

---

**What participants understood well:**
1. [OBSERVATION 1]
2. [OBSERVATION 2]
