## Phase 2: First Prop Firm - Forex Only (Month 3-12)

  - Split: 80% → 100% (scales to 100% after consistency)
  - Drawdown: 8% (very generous for futures)
  - Assets: ES, NQ, CL, GC, RTY
  - Cost: $2,200 (2× $1,100 eval)

## Phase 4: Maximum Scale (Month 19-24)

**Forex Prop Firms (Maxed Out):**
| Firm | Accounts | Capital | Split | Monthly Income |
|------|----------|---------|-------|----------------|
| MyForexFunds | 9 | $1.8M | 85% | $153k |
| FTMO | 6 | $1.2M | 85% | $102k |
| FundedNext | 5 | $1.0M | 95% | $95k |
| **Forex Total** | **20** | **$4.0M** | - | **$350k** |

**Futures Prop Firms (Scaled):**
| Firm | Accounts | Capital | Split | Monthly Income |
|------|----------|---------|-------|----------------|
| E8 Markets | 4 | $800k | 90% | $72k |
| Topstep | 2 | $300k | 90% | $27k |
| **Futures Total** | **6** | **$1.1M** | - | **$99k** |

**Combined Total:**
- 26 prop firm accounts
- **$5.1M funded capital**
- **$449k monthly income**
- Personal account: $2M+

**Net Worth at Month 24:** ~$7.5M

---

## Why E8 Markets for Futures?

✅ **8% drawdown** (vs 3-5% at other futures firms)
✅ **Scales to 100% split** (starts 80%, goes to 100% after consistency)
✅ **No time limit** on evaluations
✅ **Allows overnight holds** (most futures firms don't)
✅ **Copy trading friendly** (can run multiple accounts with same strategy)

**E8 Markets Drawdown Math:**
- ES futures: 1 contract = ~$50/point
- 8% of $200k = $16,000 max loss
- That's 320 points of cushion on ES (massive room)
- ATLAS's 15-20 point stops = **16-21 losses before failure** (vs 2 losses with Aqua's 3%)

---

## Threshold Strategy by Phase

### Exploration (Current): 2.5 threshold ✅
- **Goal:** Find opportunities in normal market conditions
- **Trade frequency:** 2-5 per week
- **Win rate target:** 60-65%
- **Use case:** Paper trading validation, learning market patterns

### Refinement (Month 3-6): 4.0 threshold
- **Goal:** Higher conviction trades only
- **Trade frequency:** 1-3 per week
- **Win rate target:** 65-70%
- **Use case:** When you get first prop firm funding, reduce risk

### Validation (Month 7+): 4.5 threshold
- **Goal:** Maximum quality, institutional-grade signals
- **Trade frequency:** 0-2 per week
- **Win rate target:** 70-75%
- **Use case:** When managing $2M+ in prop capital, only take best setups

**For now: Stay at 2.5** - need volume to prove the system works.

## The $1M Forex Milestone Trigger

**Why wait until $1M forex prop capital before adding futures?**

1. **Prove the system first** - Forex is 24/5, higher liquidity, easier to manage
2. **Learn one market deeply** - Master forex execution before adding complexity
3. **Build cash reserves** - $1M forex @ 10% monthly = $100k/month income = safety net
4. **Futures require more capital** - E8 Markets evals cost $1,100 vs $549 (MyForexFunds)
5. **Show track record** - Easier to pass futures evals with 6-12 months of forex profits

**When you hit $1M forex prop capital (Month 9), you'll have:**
- 6 months of live prop firm trading experience
- $600k+ in cash reserves from prop firm profits
- Proven ATLAS works at scale
- Confidence to add futures without fear

---

## Personal Account Asset Allocation

**Current (Month 0-9): Forex Only**
- 100% Forex ($182k → $500k+)

**After $1M Prop Milestone (Month 10-18): Forex + Futures**
- 60% Forex
- 40% Futures

**Future (Month 19-24): Multi-Asset**
- 40% Forex
- 30% Futures
- 20% Options (if interested)
- 10% Crypto (if interested)

**But prop firms stay segregated:**
- Forex prop accounts: Only trade forex
- Futures prop accounts: Only trade futures
- Never mix assets in same account (reduces correlation risk)

---

## Cost Breakdown to $5.1M Funded Capital

### Forex Prop Firms
- MyForexFunds: 9× $549 = $4,941
- FTMO: 6× $1,080 = $6,480
- FundedNext: 5× $999 = $4,995
- **Forex subtotal: $16,416**

### Futures Prop Firms
- E8 Markets: 4× $1,100 = $4,400
- Topstep: 2× $1,500 = $3,000
- **Futures subtotal: $7,400**

**Total Investment in Evaluations: $23,816**

**Return in Month 24:**
- Monthly income: $449k
- Evaluation cost: $23,816
- **ROI: 449k / 23.8k = 18.9:1 monthly** (or 226:1 annualized)

Even if you blow 20% of accounts and have to restart, ROI is still 150:1.

## Risk Management Rules

### Never Do This:
❌ Run same strategy on all 26 accounts simultaneously
❌ Trade correlated pairs across accounts (e.g., EUR/USD + EUR/GBP)
❌ Increase position size during losing streaks
❌ Change threshold mid-month to "chase" profits

### Always Do This:
✅ Segregate by asset class (forex accounts ≠ futures accounts)
✅ Keep personal account diversified (4 asset classes)
✅ Scale slowly (add 2-3 accounts per quarter, not 10 at once)
✅ Save 50% of prop firm profits (never spend all of it)

**Why segregation matters:**
If EUR/USD has a flash crash and you're running it on all 26 accounts = **all 26 accounts lose simultaneously**. That's $23,816 in evaluation fees gone in one event.

But if:
- 20 accounts trade forex (different pairs)
- 6 accounts trade futures (ES, NQ, CL, GC)

Then EUR/USD flash crash only affects the accounts trading EUR/USD, not the futures accounts or the accounts trading USD/JPY.
