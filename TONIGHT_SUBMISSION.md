## 🧪 QUICK DEMO COMMANDS (To Show Judges)

These commands demonstrate your working AI system:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/lvxcas/ATLAS-Presidential-AI-Challenge

# Command 1: Full evaluation with all 13 agents
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_eval.py

# Command 2: Demo with regime-shift scenario
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_demo.py --window regime-shift

# Command 3: Demo with volatility-spike scenario
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_demo.py --window volatility-spike
```

**What judges will see:**
- All 13 agents analyzing market conditions
- Risk posture: GREENLIGHT / WATCH / STAND_DOWN
- Detailed explanations for each agent's reasoning
- Risk flags: REGIME_SHIFT, HIGH_VOLATILITY, etc.
- Confidence scores and weighted aggregation

---

## 📊 KEY METRICS TO HIGHLIGHT

### Agent Architecture
- **13 independent AI agents** (not just 1 AI)
- **Multi-agent coordination** with safety-first veto rule
- **Weighted aggregation** (each agent has different importance)
- **Explainable outputs** (every decision traces to specific agents)

### Educational Design
- **Simulation-only** (safe for K-12 students)
- **Offline-first** (works without internet after setup)
- **Risk literacy focus** (teaches when NOT to act)
- **Plain-English explanations** (no jargon)

### Technical Depth
- **Machine Learning:** Ridge Regression models for volatility/drawdown forecasting
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Coordinator pattern with veto logic
- **Data Processing:** Cached historical data + synthetic stress windows
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript with 850 lines of custom CSS

## 🗂️ KEY FILES FOR JUDGES TO REVIEW

Direct judges to these files to see your work:

1. **AI Agents (The Core Innovation):**
   - `Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/agents/` - All 13 agent implementations
   - `Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/core/coordinator.py` - Multi-agent coordination logic
   - `Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_utils.py` - Indicators and baseline

2. **Evaluation Results:**

## 🎬 IF JUDGES ASK FOR LIVE DEMO

Run this command and share your screen:

```bash
python3 Agents/ATLAS_HYBRID/quant_team_demo.py --window regime-shift
```

**Walk them through the output:**

1. **Agent Roster:** "We have 13 independent AI agents, each looking at different risk dimensions"

2. **Scenario Analysis:** "This is a regime-shift scenario—calm market that suddenly changes direction"

3. **Agent Breakdown:** "Each agent scores risk from 0 (calm) to 1 (high uncertainty):
   - MonteCarloAgent: 1.00 (detected high tail risk)
   - MarketRegimeAgent: 0.70 (detected choppy regime)
   - DivergenceAgent: 0.65 (momentum weakening)"

4. **Coordination:** "The coordinator aggregates these with weighted voting and applies a safety-first veto rule"

5. **Output:** "Final posture: WATCH (elevated risk). Students see exactly WHY—not just a black-box prediction"
