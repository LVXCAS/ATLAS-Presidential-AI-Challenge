# Legacy UI (Disabled)

This folder contains the original Bloomberg-style dashboard UI and related
services/stores. It is intentionally moved out of `frontend/src` so the
Track II showcase site can compile cleanly and stay simulation-only.

If you need the legacy UI later, move these folders back into `frontend/src`
(or selectively re-import components) and restore any required themes.
